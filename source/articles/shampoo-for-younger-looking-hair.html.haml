  The shampoo you use to wash your hair can dramatically reduce signs of aging and make you look younger. That's because a good anti-aging shampoo is loaded with essential nutrients and natural ingredients that improve color, shine and overall health. Here's what to look for.

%h2 1. High Content of Argan Oil

  We've covered this before in our post about the
  = link_to "benefits of argan oil,", "http://skabuorganics.com/articles/10-proven-benefits-moroccan-argan-oil-shampoo/"
  so this is a recap. Argan oil is high in essential fatty acids that reduce aging, and protects against environmental damage caused by UV radiation. It also repairs split ends by coating the hair shaft, which reduces breakage and drying.

%h2 2. Never Use a Shampoo With Sulfates Or Parabens
%p
  Sulfates have been linked to cancer and to eye damage, which are things that will undoubtedly make you look older. Parabens have been linked to breast cancer. If you want to live longer and look younger, sulfates and parabens are best to be avoided.

%h2 3. Jojoba Oil (great for hair AND skin!)

%p
  Jojoba oil is high in nutrients like vitamin E, vitamin B, chromium, cooper and zinc. It is an excellent skin moisturizer, so when the suds end up on your face and body during your shower it can reduce skin wrinkles as well! It will also make your hair shiny, soft, more manageable and less frizzy.

%h2 4. Look for Products with Horsetail Extract
%p
  Horsetail has been used for centuries as a way to help with hair loss, baldness or thinning hair. Also, because it is very high in naturally occuring silica, it can help with split ends, making your hair look healthy and beautiful.
